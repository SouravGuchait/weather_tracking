# Weather & Tracking System

###  Overview

The **Weather & Tracking System** is a distributed backend project that integrates weather data collection, location tracking, and real-time stream processing.
It’s designed to simulate a real-world architecture using modern backend and data engineering technologies.

---

###  Architecture Blueprint

**Frontend / Admin**

* **Django** → Provides dashboard for users, authentication, and weather data visualization.

**Backend Services**

* **FastAPI** → Handles core APIs for collecting and processing weather + location data.

**Databases**

* **PostgreSQL** → Stores structured data (users, processed weather records).
* **Cassandra** → Stores unstructured or raw weather and location logs.

**Streaming & Task Management**

* **Kafka** → Real-time stream for weather/location event logs (IoT simulation).
* **Redis + Celery** → Background job management (fetching periodic updates, sending notifications).

**Containerization**

* **Docker** → Containerizes all services for easy deployment and scaling.

---

### 🧠 Key Features

* ✅ User authentication and dashboard (Django)
* 🌍 Real-time weather & location API (FastAPI)
* 🗃️ Structured + unstructured data storage (PostgreSQL + Cassandra)
* ⚙️ Automated background jobs (Celery + Redis)
* 📡 Stream simulation of IoT weather sensors (Kafka)
* 🐳 Fully containerized setup (Docker)

Would you like me to also include a **system architecture diagram (Mermaid format)** inside the README (so it auto-renders on GitHub)? It would visually show how Django ↔ FastAPI ↔ Kafka ↔ Databases ↔ Redis/Celery interact.
